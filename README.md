# Learning Tetris with Python and Pygame

A simple Tetris game project designed for learning Python programming with your child!

## Project Structure

- `tetris.py` - Main game file with the game loop and display
- `pieces.py` - Tetris piece definitions and piece class
- `game_logic.py` - Game mechanics and helper functions
- `requirements.txt` - Python dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the game:
   ```
   python tetris.py
   ```

## What's Implemented

âœ… Basic game window and grid display
âœ… Score display
âœ… Game loop structure
âœ… Tetris piece definitions
âœ… Basic piece class

## What Your Son Can Implement

ðŸ”¨ **Piece Movement Controls**
- Left/Right arrow keys to move pieces
- Down arrow to move faster
- Up arrow to rotate pieces

ðŸ”¨ **Collision Detection**
- Check if pieces can move to new positions
- Prevent pieces from going outside the grid
- Prevent pieces from overlapping

ðŸ”¨ **Piece Rotation**
- Rotate pieces 90 degrees clockwise
- Handle rotation near walls and other pieces

ðŸ”¨ **Line Clearing**
- Detect when lines are completely filled
- Remove filled lines
- Move remaining lines down

ðŸ”¨ **Game Over Detection**
- Check if pieces reach the top
- Display game over screen

ðŸ”¨ **Enhanced Features** (Advanced)
- Falling speed that increases over time
- Preview of next piece
- Hold piece functionality
- Sound effects

## Learning Objectives

- Game loop programming
- 2D arrays and coordinate systems
- Object-oriented programming
- Event handling
- Basic game physics
- Problem-solving and debugging

## Tips for Teaching

1. Start with the simplest feature (piece movement)
2. Test each feature thoroughly before moving to the next
3. Use print statements to debug
4. Break complex problems into smaller steps
5. Celebrate small victories!

Have fun learning together! ðŸŽ®
